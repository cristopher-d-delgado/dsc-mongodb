    "## Perform CRUD Operations in MongoDB Atlas GUI Online\n",
    "To ease into using MongoDB, let's quickly create a database using the __MongoDB Atlas GUI (graphic user interface)__ to perform some CRUD operations in MongoDB. Then, once we have a basic understanding of MongoDB's functionality we can dive into performing CRUD operations in MongoDB with Python. The basic steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a MongoDB Atlas account\n",
    "* Create and connect to a __cluster__ in MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "* Build a database and configure your cluster\n",
    "* Load sample data to your MongoDB Atlas database\n",
    "\n",
    "After we complete these steps, we can perform CRUD operations with MongoDB Atlas GUI online. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a MongoDB Atlas Account\n",
    "1. The first step is to create a __MongoDB Atlas__ account, which will allow us to explore MongoDB in the cloud instead of installing MongoDB to our local machine. This approach will help you in three ways:\n",
    "    * It simplifies the setup and configuration which will allow us to __begin performing _CRUD_ operations more quickly__.\n",
    "    * It provides you with __experience working with cloud based tools__ which are becoming increasingly more common in the industry.\n",
    "    * It gives you __free access to computational resources__ on a shared server which may allow your code to __run faster__ than it would on your local machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To create an account, visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_amers-us_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624338&adgroup=115749704063&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvqGcBhCJARIsAFQ5ke4Wxh0EcYUXOyhVoKfyoJmRhx-9eFm49z9whf6iOg08k5CTEzlDD58aAmMrEALw_wcB)\n",

    "In data science, we often perform operations that are __computationally expensive__. \n",

    "* This can be especially true when it comes to working with large datasets, bulky files, and/or complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, performing operations that were especially computationally expensive required a lot of overhead, which included creating __clusters__ or groups of computers that were networked together to distribute the computational burden and process the information more quickly.\n",
    "* In cloud computing this concept is **virtualized** which allows users to connect to clusters remotely in order to use more powerful compute resources and storage space (among other benefits). \n",
    "* Users connect to storage and compute resources via their web brower or desktop application.\n",
    "* This lowers the up-front cost of building, maintaining, and using a database by allowing companies to pay for resources based on their needs instead of spending lots of cash on servers that may not be appropriate for their needs in the long term. \n",
    "\n",
    "A __shared server__ is a server that is provisioned to multiple users at once. \n",
    "* This means that the data and applications of many users are stored on the same server and share computer resources.\n",
    "* At times, there will be variability in how fast or slow your queries are executed depending on how many users are using the server at a given time.\n",
    "* Shared servers are a cost effective way to **sandbox** or experiment with using cloud services before paying for dedicated resources. Databases, applications, and websites that have high demands for compute resources, storage, or security will generally opt for a __dedicated server__."
